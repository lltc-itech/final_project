    <h2> What its like to Be Native American</h2>
    <p>
        Native Pride is to understand and respect ones culture demonstrably by sharing it, without anger
        or resentment. Most Native Americans like to be called by the tribe they are from though some Native American groups 
        dont have a problem being called indigenous. When Colombus First landed in What is now called America
        he believed he landed in the shores of south asia, columbus convinced he was correct started called us indios which means
        people from the indus valley.Or others say that he thought he landed in india so he called us indians.
          Being Native is much more Than What your being called its about honoring our ancestors and all that they lived through, in 
          the begining befor colonization we had lived our lives with Tradition Knowlede of plants, animals, medicine, hunted and trapped during the time of the season.
