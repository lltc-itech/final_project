# Final Project - Build a Website

Let's use everything we've learned this semester to build a website. I would like to give you as much freedom as possible for this assignment, so I will not restrict the topic of your website, but I will give some suggestions and then some requirements for this project.

## Suggested Topics

* A personal profile or resume
* A hobby or interest
* A PSA or informational site
* A blog or other periodic site

You are not restricted to these, but they hopefully give you an idea of the sort of scope and ambition this project will ask of you.

Once you have selected a topic, I'd recommend that you start doing two things. First, jot down some notes or start writing content in another text editor or word processor so it can be spell-checked or edited. This makes it easy to copy and paste the text into an `html` document so you can tag it up.

Start thinking about layout. You have a few options for how to style things (and style it you must!). You can style it with pure CSS, but you may also opt to use Bootstrap. The downside to using Bootstrap is that it will make other styling trickier and we never covered (and won't in this course) how to customize Bootstrap. Still, we will go over simple things you can do to change things up.

## Requirements

* Must consist of multiple web pages. Probably about 3.
* The pages must be cohesive with each other.
    * Same nav bar, color schemes, etc.
* You must style it.
    * You can choose to use Bootstrap or pure CSS, but you must include some styling.
* You must use images. At least one image per page.
* You are free to add any other media you like, but don't include things like auto-play background music. People don't like it.
* No low-effort submissions. Give this some love. We're looking for a cohesive experience that demonstrates your understanding of the three languages we have studied this semester.
* You can include basic functionality with JavaScript, but you do not have to write full-fledge computer programs in JS. We are front-end web developers here.
* Have some fun with this!

As always, if you have any questions about the assignment or its requirements, let me know!
